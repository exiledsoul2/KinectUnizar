1. Restrict the search area to a predifed number of pixels
2. Affine transformation of patches as the camera moves 
3. (Wishful) structure for all the different settings
4. Move Patches into its own class so that functions like transformation can be called on each
5. Organize the code into more a logical bunch .. so tat data sharing is easy
